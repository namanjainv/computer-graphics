* Get pyopengl and pyopengl-accelerate installed.  The best
  way to do this is using Anaconda.

  Here's what I have installed:

    $ conda list opengl
    # packages in environment at /home/dalioba/anaconda3:
    #
    # Name                    Version                   Build  Channel
    pyopengl                  3.1.1a1                  py37_0  
    pyopengl-accelerate       3.1.3b1          py37hdd07704_0
    $

* Run the example using Python 3:

    $ python --version
    Python 3.7.4
    $ python pyopengl_sample.py

* Once the program is running, these commands are available:

  ESC -- exit the program.
  s   -- save a screenshot and a depth map, both as PNG files.
  g   -- grow the dimensions by 15%.
  r   -- reset the dimensions to their initial values.

* The window can be resized also by grabbing the edge or corner
  and dragging.  At present, this causes the screenshot images to
  be screwed up.  Using r to reset the window size 'fixes' this
  problem.

* First person to email me a revised version of the script that
  doesn't have this issue WHEN RUN IN MY ENVIRONMENT scores a
  bonus point.

* I'm looking into this myself.  As soon as I realize what's up,
  I'll send an email to the class.  At that point, no bonus point
  will be awarded, so think fast! :)

* Take a look at the code for this example.  It has some
  interesting features.
